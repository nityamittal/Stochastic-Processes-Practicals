(a) Discrete State Space
(b) Continuous State Space

3. Demonstrating Bernoulli process. Specifically, WAP to find the probability that in case a Bernoulli process: 
(a) out of n trials k are successes, (b) kth success occurs at the nth trial.
For example: The reliability assurance given by a company for its fuses is as per Bernoulli distribution with the probability of a specific fuse being defective as 0.05, independent of others. Fuses are being sold in a packing of 20 each with the money back guarantee that no more than 3 fuses were defective in a packet of 20.
(a) Find the expected number of packets for which money is to be return out of 1000 such packets sold.
(b) In case packets are sold to customers in a specific order, find the probability that 20th customer will be the 2nd one for which the money will be refunded.
(c) In case fuse in packets are placed in a specific order, find the probability that 12th fuse will be the 2nd defective fuse.

4. Demonstrating Poisson Process. WAP to find the probability that in case of Poisson process with rate λ, in a length of time t there are exactly k arrivals.
For example: Consider a transistor battery having exponential lifetime with mean as 2 months. In case six such spares batteries are available and if the time to replace a battery is negligible, find the probability that transistor will work for at least one year. In case mean failure times of the successive spare batteries are given by 2/n, then find this probability.

5. WAP to find the expected waiting time until the nth renewal in case of a renewal process with renewal cycle length distributed
(a) normally with mean μ and standard deviation σ,
(b) exponentially with parameter λ
Demonstrate it by taking suitable values for (a) and (b) both

6. WAP to find the probability that in case of an unrestricted simple random walk, at the nth instant particle lies between two specified limits. Find this probability by taking suitable values of the parameters p, q, n, j and k.
   
7. Demonstrating Simple Random Walk (Cont.) WAP to find the probability that in case of:
(i) An unrestricted simple random walk the particle is at the kth position at time n using the CLT
(ii) A random walk with two absorbing barriers, the probability of absorption at a specific barrier
(iii) A random walk with two reflecting barriers, steady state probability distribution for the possible states.
Evaluate all these for designing specific example.

8. Demonstrating Markov Chain. WAP to find the n-step transition probability in case of a Markov Chain. Implement the same by considering a suitable example.

9. Demonstrating Markov Chain (Cont.) WAP to implement following special cases in case of a Markov Chain
(a) To find steady state probabilities in case of ergodic Markov Chain.
(b) To find that the specific state in a Markov chain is a recurrent or transient.

10. Demonstrate M/M/1 Queuing Model using a suitable example. 
(a) Expected number of customers waiting in the queue/system
(b) Expected waiting time in the queue/system
(c) Expected number of idle/busy periods.
(d) Expected number of customers served in a busy period. (Incomplete example question)
Question used for implementation:
Consider an Airport runway for arrivals only, arriving aircraft join a single queue for the runway, Exponentially distributed service time with a rate, µ = 27 arrivals/hour, Poisson arrivals with a rate, λ = 20 arrivals/hour
Find:
(a) Expected number of aircraft on the system
(b) Expected number of aircraft on the runway
(c) Average time spent on the system
(d) Average time spent on the runway
